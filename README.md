Inclusive Language (Gender-Neutral language), available in two
versions:

* VFI (French Inclusive version - version en français inclusif): 4
  types of linguistic phenomenon (coordination of feminine and
  masculine forms; feminization of functions; combination of feminine
  and masculine flexion = inclusive writing; neutralization)

  corpus than VFI except that French Inclusive spans have been
  rewritten into Standard French

Both corpora are annotated into:

* French Inclusive spans: "Inclusif" tag
